# Ink Language Server

A minimal implementation of the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)] for ink.

[Language Server Protocol (LSP)]: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification

⚠️ It's under heavy development.

## Features
- [x] Diagnostics
- [x] Statistics (through extensions)
- [x] Go to definition & Hovers
- [ ] Multi-root support
- [ ] Story Previews
- [ ] Auto completion
- [ ] Refactoring

## Limitations

The Language Server only supports the `file://` scheme when exchanging URIs.

## Getting started

The server uses standard I/O to communicate with language clients. To start the server from your language client, run:

```shell
$ inklecate -l
```

### Writing a client

#### Configuration Settings
The server supports one configuration setting.

- `ink.languageServer.mainFilePath` is the path to the main ink file, used by `inklecate` to build the story. If the setting is not provided, the current buffer sent by the client will be treated as the main file.

The server automatically handles `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notifications from clients and will recompile all open documents when configuration changes.

### Logs
The language server is quite chatty, logs are stored in the following directories:

- **Windows:** `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\inklecate\language_server.txt`
- **Linux:** `/home/<UserName>/.config/inklecate/language_server.txt`
- **macOS:** `/Users/<UserName>/.config/inklecate/language_server.txt`

### Debugging

To test the server, you can take advantage of the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/ephread/vscode-ink).

Once an ink file is opened in VS Code, the extension will start the language server and a debugger can then be attached to the `inklecate` process.

### Architectural Overwiew

#### Introduction
The language server is built on top of [Omnisharp's base implementation] which relies heavily on dependency injection and interface-based programming.

`LanguageServerHost` is the entry point. It instantiates the language server, registers the request handlers against it and builds the dependency container.

Request handlers are registered through their types. The server will instanciate them when required and resolve their dependencies automatically. The most important handler is `InkTextDocumentHandler`, which responds to [text document synchronisation] requests.

#### Virtual Workspace & File Handlers

`VirtualWorkspaceManager` is a singleton storing the current state of the workspace. It's tracking opened buffers (which are likely different from the disk versions) as well as compilation results for further use.

The workspace manager works in tandem with `WorkspaceFileHandler`, which is in charge of loading and providing the content of the files present in the workspace. `WorkspaceFileHandler`s abstract away whether the file need to be loaded from the disk, or from the virtual workspace. `WorkspaceFileHandler`s are also transients and define a resolution context: they depend on the current document making the request. In other words, a context defines how to resolve the relative paths of the native `INCLUDE` directive.

A _main document_ is defined as the ink file provided to the compiler.

In workspaces without a main document, files are compiled in isolation. They become their own resolution contexts and _main documents_. But in workspaces defining a _main document_, that document is the resolution context.

#### Compilation & Diagnostics

When the client opens a document or reports that a document was changed, `InkTextDocumentHandler` asks `DiagnosticManager` to perform a compilation and push any errors/statistics it found to the client.

`DiagnosticManager` then creates a `Diagnostician`. `Diagnostician`s parse/compile the project, generate statistics and store the result in the workpsace for further use. Any errors reported by the compiler are tracked and transformed into Diagnostics which can be pushed to the client.

#### Definitions & Hovers

When the client requests a definition, `InkDefinitionHandler` asks `DefinitionManager` to find the token currently under the cursor and return the location of the definition if applicable. Hover requests work in a similar way, using `InkHoverHandler`.

`DefinitionManager` then either creates a `DefinitionFinder` if it doesn't exist or retrieve the existing one for the current document. `DefinitionFinder`s look through the compilation result to find which token is currently under the cursor and resolve its definition location.

#### Concurrency & Parallelism

The server takes advantage of C#'s concurrency model which should be sufficient to ensure a responsive server. Since all the features are tied to a successful compilation anyway and must wait for its result, offloading the compilation to a background thread probably doesn't make sense.

### Desirable Features

#### Multi-root workspaces

Supporting [multi-root workspace] would be a nice addition.

#### Code Completion

A much needed feature. It shouldn't be too hard to build a list of suggestions from the compilation results. Things to consider:

1. the completion needs to be available while a project can't build. Maybe keep track of the last successful result?
2. it can be hard to figure out the context on a project that doesn't build; maybe traversing the partial tree coupled with a few regular expressions ran against the current line would be enough to figure out the context.
3. performance issues, how fast can the server build the project and provide completion as the user types?
4. the API for [`textDocument/completion`] seems complex.

#### Story Preview

Supporting previews on the server side should be straightforward. `CommandLinePlayer.cs` gives the general idea.

Extensions can be used to communicate between the client and the server. The language server protocol allows the client to execute commands on the server through [`workspace/executeCommand`]. Hence, the client could request a preview by sending the `previewStory` command. Then, the server would notify the client through the following requests:

- `preview/text` – the client should display the content as text;
- `preview/tag` – the client should display the content as tags;
- `preview/choice` – the client should display the content as a choice option;
- `preview/prompt` – the client should ask the user to select previoulsy displayed options;
- `preview/endOfStory` – the client should indicate that the story ended;
- `preview/error` – the client should prominetly display the runtime error.

After receiving a `preview/choice` request, the client could send back the choice through a command named `chooseChoice` or `selectOption`. The wording is not intended to be final.

It's unknown at this point whether Omnisharp's base implementation supports custom requests.

#### Refactoring

Refactoring shouldn't be too difficult to implement, but any issues with the implementation might wreck havoc on projects. Things to consider:

1. refactoring should only be allowed in a clean state, after a successful compilation and before another compilation is attempted (see [`textDocument/prepareRename`]);
2. while we currently keep track of declarations for knots, stitches, etc., we don't keep track of references.

About #2: It would take too long to find all the references after each compilation. Luckily, [`textDocument/rename`] isn't expected to be instantaneous and supports sending progress updates, so a fresh traversal could be performed for each request.
